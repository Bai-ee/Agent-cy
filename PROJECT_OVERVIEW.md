# AI Agent Taskforce - Project Overview

## Project Architecture

The AI Agent Taskforce is a voice-driven multi-agent system that uses a Twilio phone interface to receive tasks, identify their types, and delegate them to specialized AI agents. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and capable of handling various types of tasks through natural language interactions.

### System Components

1. **Lead Agent (Voice Interface)**
   - Twilio-powered voice agent that receives phone calls
   - Processes natural language through speech-to-text
   - Identifies task types from conversations
   - Provides voice responses using text-to-speech
   - Stores conversations and tasks in Firebase

2. **Task Management System**
   - Analyzes conversations to detect potential tasks
   - Categorizes tasks by type (reminder, research, content creation, etc.)
   - Stores tasks in Firebase Firestore
   - Provides a dashboard for task monitoring and management

3. **Specialized Agents** (In Progress)
   - **Reminder Agent**: Sets and manages time-based reminders
   - **Web Scraper**: Researches information online
   - **Copywriter**: Generates written content
   - **Graphic Designer**: Creates and edits images
   - **Social Media Manager**: Posts and manages social media content
   - **Project Manager**: Approves and coordinates agent tasks

4. **Dashboard**
   - Next.js web application
   - Displays task history and status
   - Allows filtering and management of tasks
   - Shows conversation history

5. **Database (Firebase)**
   - Stores conversation history
   - Manages task queue and status
   - Tracks specialized agent activities

## Code Samples and Implementation Details

### Task Detection Logic

The system uses pattern matching to identify potential tasks from user speech:

```javascript
// From twilio-voice-solution.js
function analyzeConversation(conversationData) {
  const messages = conversationData.messages || [];
  const lastUserMessage = messages
    .filter(m => m.role === 'user')
    .pop();
  
  if (!lastUserMessage || !lastUserMessage.content) return null;
  
  const userText = lastUserMessage.content.toLowerCase();
  
  // Detect reminder tasks
  if (userText.includes('remind me') || userText.includes('set a reminder')) {
    return {
      type: 'reminder',
      priority: 'medium',
      text: lastUserMessage.content,
      detectionSource: 'trigger phrase match',
      triggerPhrase: 'remind me'
    };
  }
  
  // Detect research tasks
  if (userText.includes('research') || userText.includes('find information')) {
    return {
      type: 'research',
      priority: 'medium',
      text: lastUserMessage.content,
      detectionSource: 'trigger phrase match',
      triggerPhrase: 'research'
    };
  }
  
  // Detect content creation tasks
  if (userText.includes('write') || userText.includes('draft') || userText.includes('create content')) {
    return {
      type: 'content_creation',
      priority: 'medium',
      text: lastUserMessage.content,
      detectionSource: 'trigger phrase match',
      triggerPhrase: 'write'
    };
  }
  
  // Additional task types can be detected here
  
  return null;
}
```

### Firebase Task Storage

```javascript
// From twilio-voice-solution.js
async function storeAgentTask(taskData, conversationData) {
  try {
    // Ensure all values are defined
    const sanitizedTask = {
      type: taskData.type || 'unknown',
      priority: taskData.priority || 'medium',
      status: 'pending',
      text: taskData.text || 'No description provided',
      detectionSource: taskData.detectionSource || 'manual',
      triggerPhrase: taskData.triggerPhrase || '',
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      conversationId: conversationData.id || null,
      lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    // Store in potential_tasks collection
    const taskRef = db.collection('potential_tasks').doc();
    await taskRef.set(sanitizedTask);
    console.log(`✅ Stored potential task with ID: ${taskRef.id}`);
    
    // Special handling for reminder tasks
    if (taskData.type === 'reminder') {
      await createReminderFromTask(taskRef.id, sanitizedTask, conversationData);
    }
    
    return taskRef.id;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error storing task:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Testing and Validation

Currently, testing is done through:
- Manual test calls using test-voice-solution.js and make-call.js
- Dashboard inspection of stored tasks
- Console logging of system operations

Areas for test enhancement:
- Automated test suite for agent functionality
- Integration tests for system components
- Load testing for scalability validation

## Conclusion

The AI Agent Taskforce is a functional voice-driven system capable of identifying tasks from natural language conversations and storing them for later processing. The core architecture is in place, with the Lead Agent and task identification system working properly. The next major development phase involves implementing the specialized agents and enhancing the dashboard functionality for a complete end-to-end solution.
